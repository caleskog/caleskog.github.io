## Welcome to my lonely corner of the Internet

Hi there!

Are you a curious netizen, an inspiring programmer, a fully fledged professor in academia, or just a lost soul searching comfort. Do not worry! Here you will be entertained, find code in the most interesting of programming languages (my opinion), articles, or whatever else I might add.

So go on now. Step forward and follow me in a wild, long road for the endless journey of one's curious mind.
