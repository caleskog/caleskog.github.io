Hi my name is Christoffer Ã…leskog. I am a Ph.D student with a focus on machine learning and domain-specific hardware accelerators.

In this website you can find information about publications I have published, post about interesting endeavours and stuff I sometimes find, and other things I do.

A link to my CV will be published soon.
