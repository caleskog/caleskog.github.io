Finaly, after procrastinating with this for way too long, I have finaly started with creating my own private website. Hopefully this will be a recurrent thing and not just a short project that will dissapear in a sea of different, competing, ideas. But anyhow a little information about this website of mine.

This website is hosted on Github pages as you might have guessted, using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with the theme [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima). I might change this later, as I don't quite like static websites. Although I do not know how to program in the different web languages like html, css, javascript and such. I am more of a system programmer, focusing on code that is closer to the hardware and memory.

This is the end of my short first post.

See you!
